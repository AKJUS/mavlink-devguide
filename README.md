# MAVLink Developer Guide

MAVLink is a very lightweight, header-only message marshalling library for micro air vehicles. 

It can pack C-structs over serial channels with high effiency and send these packets to the ground control station. It is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.

The protocol is highly efficient with minimal overhead and scales from bandwidth-constrained links to high-bandwidth IP and OFDM links.

MAVLink was first released early 2009 by Lorenz Meier.
